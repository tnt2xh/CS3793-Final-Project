<h2>Hayden Hughes | cic693</h2>
<h3>Source for this project is https://github.com/fediazgon/cone-detector-tf</h3>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<hr>
<p>To run this repo we will need Anaconda, opencv-python, tensorflow.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<hr>
<p>Once Anaconda has been downloaded you will need to go to the https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html. Once you have launched Navigator you will need to find the program "Spyder". <br>

    Once Spyder is open we are going to then open the folder that has our python files in it. Once we find those we want to start them in Spyder.<br>
    
    Changing Input video
    If you want to run the software on a different video than the one already in the repo for testing you would change that in the cone_detection.py . The line that you are going want to change for the input will have the variable name VIDEO_PATH, just change that to the correct path of the new input.<br></p>
