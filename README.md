## Reqiurements 

To use and get the code running install the following below.

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- opencv-python
- tensorflow

## Usage

Once Anaconda has been downloaded you will need to go to the [Anaconda Navigator] (https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html). Once you have launched Navigator you will need to find the program "Spyder".

Once Spyder is open we are going to then open the folder that has our python files in it. Once we find those we want to start them in Spyder.

###Changing Input video
If you want to run the software on a different video than the one already in the repo for testing you would change that in the ```cone_detection.py ```. The line that you are going want to change for the input will have the variable name ```VIDEO_PATH```, just change that to the correct path of the new input.
